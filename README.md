# Landing Page

## About 

[This](https://proj-page-land.netlify.app) is a sample landing page for an imaginary company/product, with CSS flashiness and JavaScript functionalities like scroll animations, etc.

This project also utilizes Git to maintain a version control of these files, hosted on a remote repository on GitHub.

The ultimate end goal, process-wise, of this project is to get these files hosted as a webpage on a suitable hosting service that provides services for free. 

## Aim

The following project is an attempt by me to create a responsive landing page for the purpose of displaying the knowledge I've gained so far (May 2023) in HTML,CSS, JavaScript, Git, and (tangentially related) Linux.  


## Technologies Used
- HTML 
- CSS (vanilla, Flexbox, Grid)
- JavaScript
- Git (for version control purposes)

## Software Used
- VisualStudio Code (for coding)
- Brave Browser (for previewing and debugging)
- Neovim (for editing log files and this README.md file)
- GitHub (for hosting the files on a remote repository)
- Zathura (for viewing pdfs)
- Tabbed (PWMT program to add tab features to existing programs)
- Kitty terminal emulator (for executing git CLI commands)
- Pop_OS! (operating system; distro of Ubuntu, which itself is a distro of Debian, a variant of the GNU/Linux OS with the Linux kernel)
